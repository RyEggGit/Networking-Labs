## Question 1
*Write a Python function that receives Î» as one of its arguments and that returns a single random sample
drawn from an exponential random distribution. Using this function, write a short piece of Python code
to generate 1000 exponential random variables with Î»=75. What is the mean and variance of the 1000
random variables you generated? Do they agree with the expected value and the variance of an
exponential random variable with Î»=75? Your values will not be exact. Why not? Note: if you do not
know what you are expecting to see, you will need to look it up.*

| **Statistic** | **Computed Value**       | **Expected Value**        |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Mean          | 0.0133048956165309        | 0.0133333333333333        |
| Variance      | 0.0001716209800562        | 0.0001777777777778        |

They can't be exact because we are running a finite amount of experiments on a random variables. As we increase
the number of experiments we can got close the theoretical expected and variance but will never be able to truly reach it.

Here's the code ðŸ˜Š
```python
import math
import random

def exponential_distribution(lam: int) -> float:
    U = random.random()
    return (-1/lam) * math.log(1 - U)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    RATE_PARAMETER = 75
    EPOCH = 1000

    # Generate samples
    samples: list[float] = [exponential_distribution(RATE_PARAMETER) for _ in range(EPOCH)]

    # Calculate mean and variance
    mean = sum(samples) / EPOCH
    variance = sum([(x - mean) ** 2 for x in samples]) / EPOCH

    # Expected values for comparison
    expected_mean = 1 / RATE_PARAMETER
    expected_variance = (1 / RATE_PARAMETER) ** 2

    print(f'Mean: {mean:.16f} (expected: {expected_mean:.16f})')
    print(f'Variance: {variance:.16f} (expected: {expected_variance:.16f})')


```
